# PresentationsAndReports

This repository is to showcase my presentations and reports related to my work in fluid mechanics research and data science. 

LatticeBoltzmannSolutions_ML_DCASS2018 : 
Used Lattice Boltzmann methods to simulate flow in a lid driven cavity. Performed GPU and CPU computing using Pycuda and Cython to parallelize the simulation. Performed (Principal Component Analysis (PCA) Analysis to reduce the data storage. Explored Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN) using Keras and Scikit-learn to study Machine Learning's efficacy in prediction of fluid flows. 

AutomaticAortaSegmentation_DCASS2020 : 
Automated the segmentation of aorta from MRI scan data using MATLAB. Presented the results in DCASS 2020.
